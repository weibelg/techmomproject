        <div class="blueBack">
            <h1>Friends Supporting Each Other in Creating Healthy Habits</h1><br>
            <p>We all do better in keeping the goals we've planned if we know someone is checking in on us. This is a group of friends finding fun ways to keep each other accountable. I'm working on transitioning to a web-based platform, but for now everything
                takes place in this <a src="https://www.https://www.facebook.com/groups/hhh2022">FACEBOOK GROUP</a>. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="grayBack">
            <h1>Nothing for Sale. Nothing to Buy</h1><br>
            <p>Many of us will be setting foundational habits around fitness and food. Let me stress that you do not need pills, shakes, bars, or expensive programs to improve your eating and fitness habits. You will never be asked to buy-in (or promote)
                any programs or purchase any products, but I reserve the right to pressure you to buy more whole ingredients like vegetables, grains, and beans! </p>
        </div>
        <div class="blueBack">
            <h1>How Invested Are You?</h1><br>
            <p>Feeling timid? You are invited to lurk in the FB group as a FREE member. HOWEVER, we have done this group ongoing for years, and only a very rare person gains much that way. Everyone who wants some ACCOUNTABILITY from the group pays $25 (or
                more) to the moderator. We have found through iterations that people care more, and try harder, when they have invested something. Those who pay will get a google doc TRACKER. The link is sent via FB messenger. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="grayBack">
            <h1>Winning a Prize</h1><br>
            <p> $10 from each of us goes into the pot, to be split by those with highest percentage points for sticking to their good habits and doing the group bonuses. This can be you! Everyone who earns 80% points wins back the rest of their own money.
                My goal is to have everyone win. Some of you don't feel pressure or excitement from $25, so I'm willing to hold any $ amount for you to win back from me. I feel it is important to note that LOSING WEIGHT is not a requirement for winning
                a prize in this group, but may be a side-effect or a personal goal of yours. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="blueBack">
            <h1>Your Personal Tracking Sheet</h1><br>
            <p>Foundational goals like eating well, moving your body, sleeping, and creating order, will likely show up for most of us. But, there are individualized goals like music practice, education goals, special projects, and career goals that may
                be important to you right now as well. We'll help you create a personalized tracking sheet so YOU get to decide what is important for you to be working on right now.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="grayBack">
            <h1>Science-Based Lifestyle Changes</h1><br>
            <p> No quick fixes, no miracle cures- we are here to establish lifestyle habits to keep us feeling great and living longer. Each day, an educational video or article will be up for discussion. Engaging in the group helps us become a team, learn
                strategies, and debunk misinformation.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="blueBack">
            <h1>Timeline</h1><br>
            <p>Come join the Facebook group NOW. We will start tracking our points on March 7 and end on May 1. That gives us 8 weeks to establish some solid healthy habits.

        <p>
            Hello, everybody! I'm your host, Gina Weibel.<br><br> Before transitioning into tech, I wore many hats in the community as a private and in-school music teacher, high school sports coach, group fitness instructor, swim instructor, and mother
            of four.<br><br> During the 2020 shut-down, fitness classes stopped, swimming lessons stopped, high-school sports even stopped for a while. I really missed the camaraderie and accountability I get from coaching and being active!<br><br> I
            decided to start the Happy Healthy Habits group as a volunteer project for the community. It's my way to help all of us connect as we set and achieve goals.<br><br> I hold a Fitness Nutrition Specialist certification from ACE, a Group Fitness
            Specialist certification from ACE, and an M.S. from Cornell University. I love to get a little nerdy and hope you'll join me.<br><br> -Gina Weibel
