                Hello, everybody! I'm your host, Gina Weibel.<br><br> Before transitioning into tech, I wore many hats in the community as both a private and in-school music teacher, high school sports coach, group fitness instructor, swim instructor,
                and mother of four.<br><br> During the 2020 shut-down, fitness classes stopped, swimming lessons stopped, high-school sports even stopped for a while. I really missed the camaraderie and accountability I get from coaching and being active!<br><br>                I decided to start the Happy Healthy Habits group as a volunteer project for the community. It's my way to help all of us connect as we set and achieve goals.<br><br> I hold a Fitness Nutrition Specialist certification from ACE, a Group
                Fitness Specialist certification from ACE, and an M.S. from Cornell University. I love to get a little nerdy and hope you'll join me.<br><br>
